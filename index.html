                <p>Life as an Epicodus student s not a walk in the park. You are expected to learn a lot of information in a short amount of time. Just when you feel like you have a grasp on one thing, the next day you will be required to learn twice as much. The good news is that when you finally get it, when it finally click, you feel fantastic. Learning to code is highly rewarding. Like solving a difficult puzzle, you feel the thrill when you finally figure it all out. Epicodus is nothing like a traditional classroom: it's 100% hands-on, building projects and writing code all day, every day. There are no lectures, breakout sessions, lightning talks, or anything like that. The best way to learn coding is to code, and that's what we spend our time on.</p>
                <p>Everyday at epicodus is challenging. Most class days, you'll practice pair programming: two people sharing one computer, taking turns who uses the keyboard and mouse. By working together, you catch each other's mistakes, teach each other new skills, and come up with ideas together neither of you would have had alone. Pairing is increasingly used by tech companies (like Facebook and Square), and we've found that pair programming helps you learn faster, too. At Epicodus, you'll learn how to build web sites and mobile apps from top to bottom with modern technologies and practices. More importantly than any particular skill, though, you'll learn how to think like a programmer, write good code, and pick up new skills in this fast-changing industry.</p>
                <p>The role of teachers is mostly to help you when you're stuck or don't understand something. When you have a question, you'll start by working with your pair to figure out the answer. If the two of you can't figure out the answer, you'll ask another pair of students. If you still can't figure out the answer, that's when the teachers come into play. Answering each other’s questions is one of the best ways to learn. Furthermore, minimizing your reliance on your teachers will help you grow your own problem-solving abilities very quickly. Since our teachers are Epicodus alumni themselves, they've experienced the same struggles you will, and know how best to help you through them. We have approximately 1 teacher for every 30 students.</p>

                <p>In order for your code to reflect the history of your work, you want to save it through commits at incremental working stages. In this lesson, the sample commands for commits assume you are pair programming so each commit uses the pair-commit command. If you are soloing, the command commit would replace the syntax, pair-commit.Here are some tips for making good commits as you develop.</p>
                <p>Before committing your code, run the git status command at the command prompt. This will show the files that are staged to be committed. Ensure this looks as intended. If you need to see the differences between the last commit and the currently staged files, run the git diff command. Ideally, your commits should always be snapshots of your code at a working point in its development. It is also best practice to remove debugging statements and extraneous comments (or commented-out code) before committing. An exception to this is when you are pair programming on a device (such as Epicodus) and you need to come to a stopping point before code can be resolved. Since you may not have future access to the local repository on the shared device, you would need to make a final commit (possibly not working and with comments!) to push code to a remote repository. When developers make these work-in-progress commits, they usually write the message for the commit they intend to make, with "WIP" (for Work In Progress) at the beginning - for example, "WIP update styles for admin dashboard".</p>
                <p>So, when is a good time to make a commit? It's not always easy to know. And the answer varies depending on the task you are tackling. The phrase that many developers use to describe a good commit is a "logically separate change set". In other words, if you write half of a method and make a commit, and then finish writing the method and make another commit, your commits are not "logically separate" - they should be one commit. And if two things aren't related, such as updating styles and changing backend logic, they aren't part of the same "change set", and should be different commits. Another good rule of thumb is that you should never have to write the word "and" in a commit message. If you do, it probably should be two commits instead of one. If the changes are already in place, separate commits are still possible by not adding everything to be staged at the same time.</p>

                <p>If you're curious about how we did much of the styling on this website, check out Google's Material Design Lite! Back in 2014, Google published the material design specification with a goal to provide guidelines for good design and beautiful UI across all device form factors. Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible. MDL elements can be tweaked and configured by adding CSS classes. There are many other elements available such as Card containers, Sliders, Tables, Menus, and more.</p>
                <p>Material Design Lite is built to provide a lightweight and basic set of Material Design components and templates for web sites. The project does not intend to provide structures to create all possible UX needs, but to provide a low-friction Material Design implementation you can build on. Even within Material Design itself, cards specifically, it is unfeasible to provide every combination in a seamless manner. When you find something not provided, such as dropdowns in the drawer, you may need to code your own component.</p>
                <p>MDL makes it easy to add a material design look and feel to your websites. The “Lite” part of MDL comes from several key design goals: MDL has few dependencies, making it easy to install and use. It is framework-agnostic, meaning MDL can be used with any of the rapidly changing landscape of front-end tool chains. MDL has a low overhead in terms of code size (~27KB zipped), and a narrow focus — enabling material design styling for websites.

                <p class="mdl-card__subtitle-text">Portland's famous bookstore is a city gem.<p>
              </div>
              <div class="mdl-color-text--grey-700 mdl-card__supporting-text">
                <p>One of the first places I visited after moving to Portland was Powell's bookstore. Powell's is just a short walk from from the Epicodus offices and it's well worth the short walk to see one of Portland's favorite hangouts. Powell's Books is a chain of bookstores in Portland, Oregon, and its surrounding metropolitan area. Powell's headquarters, dubbed Powell's City of Books, claims to be the largest independent new and used bookstore in the world. Powell's City of Books is located in the Pearl District on the edge of downtown and occupies a full city block between NW 10th and 11th Avenues and between W. Burnside and NW Couch Streets. It contains over 68,000 square feet, about 1.6 acres of retail floor space. CNN rates it one of the ten "coolest" bookstores in the world. </p>
                <p>Powell's was founded by Walter Powell in 1971. His son, Michael Powell, had started a bookstore in Chicago, Illinois, in 1970 which specialized in used, rare, and discounted books, primarily of an academic and scholarly nature. In 1979, Michael Powell joined his father in Portland, right after his father's store had lost its lease; within a year, they found the location that became its current headquarters. Michael bought the bookstore from his father in 1982. In 1984, Powell's opened its first branch store, in a suburban shopping center named Loehmann's Plaza, near Washington Square. The new branch was not a replica of its City of Books location; Powell was concerned that the "edgy" neighborhood of its headquarters location was limiting its customer base, so the new store was "fairly fancy" with white shelving, a tile floor, and banners over the aisles. It was also four times the size of the typical chain bookstore.</p>
                <p>It can be easy to get lost in the City of Books’ 68,000 square feet, nine rooms, three floors and 3,500 sections. In fact, losing yourself in the sprawling store (or one of its more than 1.5 million books) can be half the fun. But for those who prefer navigating over perusing, Powell’s offers a detailed map to its color-coded rooms as well as a free app that offers turn-by-turn directions to specific books. So head down to Powell's and while your there, be sure to check out their extensive tech section and buy our favorite JavaScript book, <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em></p>

                <p class="mdl-card__subtitle-text">Is Epicodus right for your programming education?<p>
              </div>
              <div class="mdl-color-text--grey-700 mdl-card__supporting-text">
                <p>Do you like working with others? Are you a self-starter? Are you not an asshole? Do you actually want to learn to code? Can you handle a challenge? These are all important questions to ask yourself before deciding on Epicodus. What language would you like to learn? Now that Epicodus offers so many different courses, we often get students unsure of what to take after they finish Introduction to Programming. If you're an Epicodus student or anybody wondering which language to learn, the first thing you need to decide is if you want to focus more on front-end or back-end development. Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take CSS and Design classes at Epicodus.</p>
                <p>If you're more interested in back-end development, you have several choices of languages: C#, Java, PHP, and Ruby are all offered at Epicodus. My best advice about how to choose is not to worry too much. Most modern programming languages have more similarities than differences, and Epicodus graduates often find themselves working in different languages than they studied in school. Back-end programmers often switch languages as they change jobs, or even as they build different types of software at the same job. So don't stress too much about making the right choice! That said, each language has found a bit of a niche, and depending on your interests, you might be attracted to one over another.</p>
                <p>Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing. </p>

I was too used to packin' gats and stuff. Now honies play me close like butter played toast. From the Mississippi down to the east coast. Condos in Queens, indo for weeks. Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak. Livin' life without fear. Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear. Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool. Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school. Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood. And it's still all good.</p>

                <p>Portland, Oregon’s largest city, sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers, in the shadow of snow-capped Mount Hood. It’s known for its parks, bridges and bicycle paths, as well as for its eco-friendliness and its microbreweries and coffeehouses. Iconic Washington Park encompasses sites from the formal Japanese Garden to Oregon Zoo and its railway. The city hosts thriving art, theater and music scenes.</p>
                <p>Named after the city in Maine, Portland was settled in the 1830s near the end of the Oregon Trail. Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods, and the timber industry was a major force in the city's early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city had developed a reputation as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world, a hub for organized crime and racketeering. After the city's economy experienced an industrial boom during World War II, its hard-edged reputation began to dissipate. Beginning in the 1960s, Portland became noted for its growing liberal political values, and the city has earned a reputation as a bastion of counterculture, a view which has proceeded into the 21st century. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center study, Portland ranks as the 8th most popular American city, based on where people want to live.</p>
                <p>Portland is home to two major league sports franchises: the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA and the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer. The Portland Thorns of the National Women's Soccer League also play in Portland. In 2015, the Timbers won the MLS Cup, which was the first professional sports championship for a team from Portland since the Trail Blazers won the NBA championship in 1977. Despite being the 19th most populated metro area in the United States, Portland contains only one franchise from the NFL, NBA, NHL, or MLB, making it America's most populated metro area with that distinction. The city has been frequently rumored to receive an additional franchise although efforts to acquire a team have failed due to stadium funding issues.</p>

The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world: 6.98 million people ascended it in 2011. The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010.</p>
                <p>The design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as "a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.</p>
                <p>The wrought iron of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tonnes, and the entire structure, including non-metal components, is approximately 10,000 tonnes. As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300 tonnes of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the 125 m2 base to a depth of only 6.25 cm, assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8 tonnes per cubic metre. Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower would contain 6,200 tonnes of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18 cm due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.</p>

                <p>Just in case you never heard of the term before, "computer hardware" refers to all the parts of the computer that you can touch.  "Computer software" generally refers to those computer related things that you can't touch. Examples of Software:  The computer code that makes this webpage appear on the screen, the code that tells the computer how to play a game or run a PowerPoint slide show, etc. Examples of Hardware:The computer equipment that you need to "run" the software, the mouse that you use to select things on the screen, the screen (or monitor) itself, the keyboard, etc</p>
                <p>Nearly everyone I know is addicted in some measure to the Internet,” wrote Tony Schwartz in a recent essay in The New York Times. It’s a common complaint these days. A steady stream of similar headlines accuse the ‘Net and its offspring apps, social media sites and online games of addicting us to distraction.There’s little doubt that nearly everyone who comes in contact with the Internet has difficulty disconnecting: People everywhere are glued to their devices.</p>
                <p>Many of us, like Schwartz, struggle to stay focused on tasks that require more concentration than it takes to post a status update. As one person ironically put it in the comments section of Schwartz’s online article, “As I was reading this very excellent article, I stopped at least half a dozen times to check my email.”There’s something different about this technology: It is both pervasive and persuasive. But who’s at fault for its overuse? To find solutions, it’s important to understand what we’re dealing with. There are four parties conspiring to keep you connected — and they may not be whom you’d expect.</p>

                <p>Like transportation in the rest of the United States, the primary mode of local transportation in Portland, Oregon is the automobile. But Portland's reputation as a well-planned city is due to Metro's regional master plan in which transit-oriented development plays a major role. This approach, part of the new urbanism, promotes mixed-use and high-density development around light rail stops and transit centers, and the investment of the metropolitan area's share of federal tax dollars into multiple modes of transportation. In the United States, this focus is atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along interstate highways, in suburbs, and satellite cities.</p>
                <p>Within the downtown area (the city center) is the Portland Transit Mall, a transit-priority corridor on which buses and light rail trains from many different parts of the region converge. First opened in 1977, and for three decades served only by buses, the transit mall underwent major changes in 2009. Tracks for light rail (MAX) were added, bus stops spaced farther apart, and the left lane opened to general traffic (but with right turns prohibited). To facilitate this major renovation and rebuilding, lasting more than two years, all bus routes using the mall were diverted to other streets (mainly 3rd and 4th avenues) starting in January 2007.</p>
                <p>TriMet operates a fleet of 603 buses on a network of 79 bus routes. Twelve of the routes are designated "Frequent Service" bus routes, with more frequent schedules than other routes. Originally intended to have buses scheduled every 15 minutes or less all day, every day (including weekends and holidays), budget cutbacks in 2009 caused TriMet to change "Frequent Service" routes to have 15 minute or less wait times only during weekday peak usage times in the morning and afternoon. In August 2014, TriMet reintroduced 15 minute or less wait times at all times during weekdays on Frequent Service routes, with the stated goal of reinstating weekend 15 minute or less wait times on these routes.</p>
